# Recursion Macros
Use recursion macros to call NMAKE recursively. Recursive sessions inherit command-line and environment-variable macros and Tools.ini information. They do not inherit makefile-defined inference rules or **.SUFFIXES** and **.PRECIOUS** specifications. To pass macros to a recursive NMAKE session, either set an environment variable with SET before the recursive call, define a macro in the command for the recursive call, or define a macro in Tools.ini.  
  
|Macro|Definition|  
|-----------|----------------|  
|**MAKE**|Command used originally to invoke NMAKE.<br /><br /> The $(MAKE) macro gives the full path to nmake.exe.|  
|**MAKEDIR**|Current directory when NMAKE was invoked.|  
|**MAKEFLAGS**|Options currently in effect. Use as `/$(MAKEFLAGS)`.  Note, /F is not included.|
